# EIPs Insights

Welcome to the Ethereum Insight Proposals (EIPs) Insights! This project aims to provide a user-friendly website that offers insights into Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) while also covering the contents of the official [ethereum/EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) repository. EIPs are design documents that provide information about new features, standards, and protocols for the Ethereum platform.

# Project Overview

- A searchable and filterable list of EIPs.
- Detailed information about each EIP, including its status, author, and description.
- Categorized view of EIPs based on their types and status.
- Links to the official repository and EIP discussions for further engagement.
