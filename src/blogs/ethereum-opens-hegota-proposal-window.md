# Ethereum Opens Hegotá Proposal Window, Deadline Set for Feb 5

Ethereum core developers have formally initiated planning for the next network hard fork, **Hegotá**, as the current Glamsterdam upgrade moves toward finalisation. The decision was confirmed during [ACDC #172](https://etherworld.co/highlights-from-the-all-core-developers-execution-acdc-call-172/).

Rather than rushing scope decisions, core teams agreed to open the Hegotá *headliner proposal process* early, giving contributors a defined window to surface ideas, receive scrutiny, and engage in live technical discussion before any selection takes place.

## Hegotá Headliner Process Formally Opens

With [Glamsterdam](https://etherworld.co/tag/glamsterdam/) on a stable path and its scope largely locked, developers agreed that the timing was right to begin structured planning for [Hegotá](https://eipsinsight.com/Blogs/timeline-for-heke-bogota). The opening of the headliner process marks the first formal step, focused on surfacing serious candidates early rather than rushing toward commitments.

This phase is intentionally front-loaded to encourage discussion, iteration, and cross-client alignment well before implementation pressure begins.

## Proposal Submission Requirements Explained

To qualify as a Hegotá headliner, contributors must [complete](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-8081-hegota-network-upgrade-meta-thread/26876?ref=etherworld.co) two mandatory steps:

- Publish a detailed proposal on Ethereum Magicians, explicitly tagged for Hegotá  
- Present the proposal during a relevant All Core Devs call for live technical discussion  

This dual requirement ensures that proposals receive both written scrutiny and real-time feedback from client teams, researchers, and protocol engineers.

## Feb 5 Marks the Hard Deadline for Headliners

All Hegotá headliner proposals must be **submitted and presented by Feb 5, 2026**. After this cutoff, proposals will move into a longer discussion and refinement phase, where trade-offs, risks, and readiness will be evaluated before any selections are made.

Developers emphasized that missing the Feb 5 deadline effectively removes a proposal from headliner consideration for this fork.

## No Forced Theme for the Next Hard Fork

During the discussion, developers briefly considered whether Hegotá should be guided by a predefined theme. The consensus was to avoid forcing alignment.

If a clear theme emerges organically from the proposals, it will be embraced. If not, developers agreed that quality, readiness, and safety matter more than narrative cohesion.

Glamsterdam is approaching finalisation with discipline. Hegotá planning has started early, with process taking precedence over urgency.

Together, these signals point to a network less focused on acceleration and more concerned with ensuring that the ground already covered remains stable before moving forward.
