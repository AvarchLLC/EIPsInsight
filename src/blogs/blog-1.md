- [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ywv6QpS2sE), [FEM Notes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eof-implementers-call-64-january-22-2025/22466/2) by Danno Ferrin

### [JSON-RPC Standardization Breakout](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1252) (Jan 20, 2024)
This is a new breakout room meeting initiated as a result of discussion to be continued from the last ACDE. 

* The discussion focused on broader goals and stakeholder involvement, emphasizing the need to refine internal processes before involving external stakeholders like wallets and RPC providers. 
* Suggestions included using the group to address consistency issues and align new feature proposals with broader stakeholder needs. 
* Key action items were identified: 
    * incorporating `eth_fillTransaction` `into the execution spec, refining and documenting new methods, ensuring RPC compatibility through rigorous testing, and improving specification documentation for better usability. 
- As next step, devs decided to continue async discussions on `eth_fillTransaction` and RPC compatibility tests on Discord. 
* Future discussions will prioritize error handling and establishing processes for integrating new features and methods.
- The next meeting will be scheduled in the next two weeks.

- **Stagnant Tag Discussion**: A few suggestions to address issues with the "Stagnant" tag for Core EIPs under active consideration.  Will bediscussed further in the next meeting.  
- **EIP Reviewers**: Proposal to introduce formal EIP Reviewer roles approved. Details to be finalized in the Editors' Workshop.  
- **Editors' [Workshop Announcement](https://github.com/ethcatherders/EIPIP/issues/372)**: Workshop planned for onboarding and discussions.  
- **[Proposal Builder Tool](https://eipsinsight.com/proposalbuilder)**:  
  - Get the .md file to document a proposal using this tool. Demo shared, tool deemed useful for new authors. 
  - Requested adding the tool link to [eips.ethereum.org](https://eips.ethereum.org).

### [EVM Resource Pricing Breakout #1](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1239) (January 15, 2025)

The Gas Repricing Working Group meeting is a new breakout focused on three key agenda items: benchmarking efforts, short-term pricing changes, and research for medium-term updates. 

Presentations included an overview of the [Nethermind gas-benchmarks tool](https://github.com/NethermindEth/gas-benchmarks) by Marek, showcasing its use in identifying bottlenecks, and [Jacek‚Äôs Gas Cost Estimator tool](https://github.com/imapp-pl/gas-cost-estimator), which proposed updated gas cost schedules tested across seven EL clients. 

Discussions addressed strategies for short-term adjustments, such as single and multi-block warming to improve efficiency, and medium-term considerations for hardforks like Fusaka and Amsterdam. Concerns around backward compatibility were highlighted, with suggestions to leverage EOF mechanisms for versioning and restrict gas schedule changes to EOF contracts. 

* **Benchmarking Efforts**:  
   - Tools presented for analyzing gas costs and addressing bottlenecks in existing schedules.  
   - Proposals to refine gas pricing schedules for greater efficiency.  
* **Short-Term Pricing Changes**:  
   - Adjustments to precompile gas costs due to benchmarking insights revealing they are underpriced.  
   - Ideas like single and multi-block warming were discussed, with efficiency gains estimated at 5-6% for single block and ~15% for multi-block. 
* **Medium-Term Strategy**:  
   - Addressed strategies for future hardforks like Fusaka & Amsterdam.  
   - Backward compatibility concerns raised about repricing, with suggestions to restrict changes to EOF contracts.  
   - Agreement that increasing gas prices historically caused breakages, while reducing prices carries lower risk.  
* **Backward Compatibility**:  
   - Suggested leveraging EOF mechanisms for versioning to mitigate issues.  
   - Discussions on feasibility of automating checks to detect potential contract breakages.  
* **Future Considerations**:  
   - Incentivizing fair contract usage without disadvantaging smaller contracts.  
   - Exploring zk-proof pricing adjustments (e.g., 10x keccak costs).
   - Dcrapis proposed a session on EVM memory pricing, potentially to be covered in a future call if time doesn‚Äôt permit.   

### Action Items  
- Draft EIPs for short-term pricing changes.  
- Continue benchmarking efforts to refine gas cost schedules.  
- Explore applying new gas schedules only to EOF contracts to preserve legacy compatibility.   
- Schedule EVM memory pricing presentation for the next call.
