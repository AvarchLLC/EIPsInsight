# Ethereum Introduces ACDG to Bring Structure to Governance Discussions

Governance took center stage during [All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) Call #227](https://etherworld.co/highlights-from-the-all-core-developers-execution-acde-call-227/), as members of the Ethereum Foundation’s protocol support team presented a set of proposals aimed at making Ethereum’s decision making processes more visible, structured, & easier to follow.

While Ethereum’s execution, consensus, & testing pipelines operate through well defined All Core Devs forums, governance conversations have historically lacked a similarly recognizable home. Topics such as editor discretion, EIP readiness, sequencing, & coordination have increasingly unfolded across scattered GitHub issues, Discord threads, & informal meetings, making them difficult to track even for regular contributors.

## Why Ethereum Governance Needed a Reset

The introduction of [ACDG (All Core Devs Governance)](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/introduce-acd-g-all-core-devs-governance/27387) reflects a growing acknowledgment that process ambiguity is no longer a minor issue. With more than [350 open pull requests](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pulls?ref=etherworld.co) currently sitting in the EIP repository, developers agreed that unclear governance pathways risk becoming a bottleneck as Ethereum continues to scale.

As Ethereum’s roadmap matures, governance questions now routinely shape upgrade outcomes. Decisions around EIP readiness, editor discretion, fork sequencing, & cross team coordination increasingly determine what ships & when.

Yet unlike execution or consensus discussions, governance lacks a single widely followed venue. This disconnect has become harder to justify as the ecosystem grows & contributor count increases.

## What ACDG Is & What It Is Not

ACDG is intended to formalize & rebrand the long running EIPIP meetings, giving governance discussions a clearer identity & more predictable structure. It is not designed to centralize authority or override existing All Core Devs processes.

Instead, ACDG aims to improve visibility & alignment, making it easier for contributors to know where governance discussions are happening & how decisions are being formed.

## Fixing Fragmentation in EIP Decision Making

Historically, governance topics have been scattered across multiple platforms, creating a fragmented decision making environment. Contributors must often monitor several channels to stay informed, increasing coordination overhead & lowering participation.

ACDG seeks to address this fragmentation by providing a recognizable home for governance level conversations, without interfering with the technical work of shipping upgrades.

Developers were explicit that ACDG is not intended to introduce additional layers of process. Instead, it aims to consolidate existing governance discussions under a clearer banner, improving discoverability without slowing decision making or increasing procedural overhead.

By giving governance conversations a consistent forum, developers hope to reduce confusion while preserving Ethereum’s open & consensus driven culture.

## Call for Input & Pooja Ranjan’s Proposal

Alongside the ACDG discussion, editors highlighted smaller but practical process improvements. One such example is a recent [Call for Input ](https://github.com/ethcatherders/EIPIP/issues/397) opened by Pooja Ranjan, examining whether future Calls for Input should move from the [EIPIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrhgOhQ_YI&ref=etherworld.co) GitHub repository to the Ethereum PM GitHub repository.

The proposal argues that the Ethereum PM repository is already the central place to find information about Ethereum meetings & enjoys significantly higher visibility across the community. In contrast, the EIPIP repository suffers from low discoverability, limiting the reach & diversity of feedback.

The ACDG proposal suggests a network increasingly willing to treat governance as core infrastructure rather than an informal afterthought. As 2026 begins, Ethereum appears focused not only on what it builds next, but on how it decides what gets built at all.
