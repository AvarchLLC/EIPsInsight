Ten years ago, on **July 30, 2015**, Ethereum's "Frontier" network went live, mining its genesis block and launching what would become the world's most programmable blockchain. Just months earlier, on **April 12, 2015**, a foundational document was published that would govern every significant upgrade to follow: **[EIP-1](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-1)**, authored by Martin Becze and [Hudson Jameson](https://x.com/hudsonjameson). This simple proposal established the transparent improvement process that has driven every protocol upgrade, token standard, consensus change and layer-2 in Ethereum's history.

From that foundational framework, over **1,000 EIPs** have been created, with **530 ERCs** (application standards), **337 Core EIPs** (protocol changes) and **22 Networking EIPs** transforming Ethereum from an [experimental "world computer"](https://etherworld.co/2024/11/15/vitalik-buterin-on-ethereum-as-the-world-computer/) into the backbone of a $400+ billion ecosystem. These proposals represent the democratic, transparent process by which one of humanity's most important technological platforms continues to evolve and improve.

## Era 1: Inception & Core Protocol (2015–2017)

### **The Foundation Years**

The foundational era began with establishing the very process by which improvements would be proposed, discussed, and implemented. This period laid the groundwork for everything that followed, creating the standards that would enable the explosion of decentralized applications.

### **Landmark EIPs:**

| EIP | Date | Core Contribution |
|-----|------|------------------|
| **[EIP-1](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-1)** | April 12, 2015 | Established the proposal process that governs Ethereum development, defining status states from Draft to Final |
| **[EIP-20](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-20) (ERC-20)** | November 19, 2015 | [Fabian Vogelsteller](https://x.com/feindura)'s fungible token standard that enabled the ICO boom and became foundation for 30,000+ tokens |
| **[EIP-721](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-721) (ERC-721)** | January 24, 2018 | [William Entriken](https://x.com/fulldecent) and team's Non-Fungible Token standard that created the foundation for the multi-billion dollar NFT ecosystem |

### **DevCon I Retrospective**

At DevCon 1 in London (November 9-13, 2015), the optimism was palpable as developers gathered to shape Ethereum's future. As Ethereum wallet designer **[Alex Van de Sande](https://x.com/avsa)** famously declared during the conference: 

> **"The internet kind of sucks. It's centralized, and it's broken but we can fix it this week."**

This sentiment captured the revolutionary spirit driving early EIP development, where developers believed they were building the infrastructure for a new decentralized web. The quote proved prophetic by the end of 2017, ERC-20 contract count had already passed 30,000, catalyzing the ICO wave that would define the next era.

## Era 2: Tokenization & Performance (2018–2020)

### **The Scaling and Standards Era**

As Ethereum matured beyond its experimental phase, the focus shifted to optimizing performance and enabling the complex token economies that would define DeFi and NFTs. This era saw the creation of standards that would support billion-dollar ecosystems and crucial gas optimizations.

### **Landmark EIPs:**

| EIP | Date | Impact & Innovation |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| **[EIP-1884](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-1884)** | March 28, 2019 | [Martin Holst Swende](https://swende.se/)'s gas cost adjustments as state grew, increasing SLOAD from 200 to 800 gas to address DoS vectors |
| **[EIP-2535](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-2535) (Diamonds)** | February 22, 2020 | [Nick Mudge](https://x.com/mudgen)'s modular smart contract standard enabling unlimited upgradeability through faceted proxy architecture|
| **[EIP-1559](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-1559)** | Specified 2019, Activated August 5, 2021 | Revolutionary base fee + tip mechanism with ETH burning that transformed fee predictability |

### **EIP-1559**

Before the London hard fork, Ethereum users faced a chaotic first-price auction system where gas prices were unpredictable and often led to massive overpayments during network congestion. **EIP-1559** introduced a two-part fee structure: a predictable **base fee** (which gets burned, making ETH deflationary) and an optional **priority tip** for miners.

**Impact by the Numbers:**
- Over **$9 billion worth of ETH** has been burned since implementation
- Transaction fee predictability improved by approximately **70%**
- Network utilization became more stable with flexible block sizes (15M target, 30M max)
- ETH inflation dropped from 4.6% to approximately **0.8% annually**

As one user noted in community feedback: 

> *"EIP-1559 transformed my DeFi experience from stressful guesswork to predictable transactions. Finally, I could budget for gas fees."*

The upgrade also introduced the concept of **Tâtonnement**, where the base fee automatically adjusts based on network demand to maintain the gas target, creating a more stable and efficient fee market.

## Era 3: Consensus & Security (2021–2023)

### **The Great Transition**

This transformative period saw Ethereum complete its most ambitious upgrade ever: transitioning from energy-intensive Proof-of-Work to efficient Proof-of-Stake, while laying the groundwork for massive scalability improvements through proto-danksharding.

### **Landmark EIPs:**

| EIP | Date | Network Impact |
|-----|------|---------------|
| **[EIP-2982](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-2982)** | September 15, 2020 | The Beacon Chain Blueprint: Danny Ryan and Vitalik Buterin's specification for "Serenity Phase 0" that launched the beacon chain as the foundation for Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake |
| **[EIP-3675](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-3675)** | July 22, 2021 | The Merge Specification: Completed the transition from PoW to PoS, reducing energy consumption by 99.95%|
| **[EIP-4844](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-4844)** | February 10, 2022 spec, March 13, 2024 mainnet | Proto-danksharding introducing "blobs" that reduced L2 data costs by **10-100×** |

### Vitalik Buterin on EIP-3675

When discussing the philosophy behind Ethereum's governance through EIPs and the significance of The Merge, Vitalik Buterin emphasized the importance of institutions over individual heroics:

> **"It's not heroes but institutions that make Ethereum work. What you really need is a structure and society that binds the tiny, inadequate speck of good that each person can do together".**

This philosophy has guided the collaborative EIP process that enabled Ethereum's democratic evolution over the past decade. The Merge itself represented the culmination of years of research and development, with the **Beacon Chain** operating successfully since December 2020 before finally merging with the mainnet.

**Post-Merge Impact:**
- Validator set grew to over **1 million validators**
- Annual ETH issuance dropped from **4.6% to 0.6%**
- Energy consumption reduced by **99.95%**, equivalent to removing the Netherlands' entire energy usage
- Network security strengthened through economic finality and slashing conditions

## Era 4: Scaling & The Future (2024–2025)

### **Infinite Scalability Horizon**

The current era focuses on scaling Ethereum to serve billions of users while maintaining decentralization and security. These recent and upcoming EIPs promise to unlock Ethereum's full potential through validator efficiency improvements and account abstraction.

### **Landmark EIPs:**

| EIP | Date/Status | Forward Focus |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| **[EIP-4788](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-4788)** | March 13, 2024 (Dencun) | Beacon block roots in EVM enabling trust-minimized access to consensus layer data for L2s and bridges |
| **[EIP-7251](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7251)** | Pectra Upgrade, May 7, 2025 | Increases validator maximum effective balance from 32 ETH to **2,048 ETH** for improved capital efficiency |
| **[EIP-7702](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7702)** | Pectra Upgrade, May 7, 2025 | Enables EOAs to delegate execution to smart contracts, providing account abstraction features like batching and gas sponsorship |
| **[EIP-4361](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-4361)** | October 11, 2021 | **Sign-In with Ethereum:** Wayne Chang and team's standard for decentralized authentication, enabling users to control their digital identity using Ethereum accounts instead of centralized providers like Google or Faceboo |
| **[EIP-5069](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-5069)** | May 2, 2022| The Editor's Handbook Story: Born from Pooja Ranjan's EIP Editor "apprentice" handbook on HackMD, this proposal formalized the long-needed documentation of EIP Editor roles and responsibilities, addressing the growing complexity of the standardization process|
| **[EIP-7587](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7587)** | December 21, 2023 | **RIP Address Reservation:** Carl Beekhuizen and team reserved precompile address range 0x0100-0x01ff for Rollup Improvement Proposals (RIPs), ensuring no conflicts between L1 and L2 precompiles | 
|**[EIP-7623](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7623)** | February 13, 2024 |  Network Upgrade Process Formalization: This proposal stemmed from Pooja Ranjan's Medium article "Shedding light on the Ethereum Network Upgrade Process," which documented the need to formalize and improve the network upgrade process after years of evolution|

### **The Pectra Revolution**

The **[Pectra upgrade](https://eipsinsight.com/pectra)** (Prague + Electra), which went live on **May 7, 2025**, represents the largest update since The Merge, introducing **11 EIPs** that fundamentally enhance Ethereum's staking mechanism and user experience.

**EIP-7251's Validator Consolidation:**
- Allows validators to stake up to **2,048 ETH** instead of managing multiple 32 ETH validators
- Enables **reward compounding** without spinning up additional validator instances
- Reduces network load by consolidating the validator set while maintaining decentralization
- Adjusts slashing penalties proportionally to maintain security (1/4,096 vs 1/32 of effective balance)

**EIP-7702's Account Abstraction:**
- Enables EOAs to **batch transactions**, **sponsor gas fees**, and **manage sub-keys**
- Preserves user identity and address history while adding smart contract capabilities
- Compatible with existing wallets and infrastructure, eliminating migration barriers
- Provides stepping stone to full account abstraction without protocol changes

### Revolutionary Proposals on the Horizon
**[EIP-7805 (FOCIL)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7805)**- Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists: A committee-based mechanism to preserve Ethereum's censorship resistance as specialized builders dominate block production. FOCIL ensures that 90% of Ethereum's decentralized validators can enforce transaction inclusion, preventing censorship by centralized builders.

**[EIP-7732 (ePBS)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7805)** - [Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation:](https://eipsinsight.com/Blogs/ePBS-EIP-7732) Integrates proposer-builder separation directly into Ethereum's protocol, eliminating reliance on external relays and creating a transparent auction mechanism for block space.

**[EIP-7892 (BPO)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7892)** - [Blob Parameter Only Hardforks:](https://eipsinsight.com/Blogs/bpo-forks-eip-7892) Introduces lightweight mechanisms for incrementally scaling Ethereum's blob capacity through specialized hard forks that modify only blob-related parameters, enabling more agile responses to L2 scaling demands.

Over the past decade, EIPs have transformed Ethereum from an experimental platform into the foundation of a new digital economy. **EIP-1's** simple governance framework to the **EIP-4844's** proto-danksharding, each proposal has contributed to a system that now processes hundreds of billions in annual transaction volume while maintaining decentralization and security.

Looking ahead, **Danksharding** will enable thousands of transactions per second through full data availability sampling. **Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization** standards will bridge traditional finance with DeFi protocols. **Account abstraction** via **EIP-7702** will make Ethereum as user-friendly as traditional web applications, removing the final barriers to mass adoption.

The story of EIPs is the story of thousands of developers, researchers, and community members working together through transparent governance to build the infrastructure for a decentralized future. As Ethereum celebrates its 10th anniversary on **July 30, 2025**, we celebrate not just the technology, but the democratic process that made it possible.
