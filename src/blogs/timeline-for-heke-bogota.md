# Tentative Scoping Timeline for Ethereum's Heka/Bogotá Upgrade

Ethereum core developers have released a tentative scoping timeline for the upcoming Heka/Bogotá network upgrade, captured in [EIP-8081](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-8081). Shared by Ethereum Foundation researcher Alex Stokes (ralexstokes), the [meta-thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-8081-heka-bogota-network-upgrade-meta-thread/26876) outlines how Ethereum will scope the fork, when proposals will be evaluated, & what decision will finalize the upgrade’s contents.

The timeline is explicitly tentative, with room for modification after the Fusaka retrospective & additional process refinements as Glamsterdam reaches mainnet.

- [Phase Two: Headliner Discussion & Finalization (Feb 5–Feb 26)](#phase-two-headliner-discussion--finalization-feb-5feb-26)
- [Phase Three: Non-Headliner EIP Proposals (From Feb 27)](#phase-three-non-headliner-eip-proposals-from-feb-27)

## Why This Timeline Matters

Ethereum’s upgrade process has matured from informal coordination into a more structured, milestone-based model. Publishing a scoping timeline early helps Ethereum:
- reduce late-stage surprises . 
- create predictability for implementers. 
- focus debate on the highest-impact goals first. 
- widen legitimacy by requiring broader ecosystem input.  
## Phase One: Fork Focus & Headliner Proposals (Jan 8–Feb 4)

The first window is designed to define high-level goals for Heka/Bogotá. During this period, [ACDE/ACDC calls](https://etherworld.co/tag/acd/) are expected to focus less on individual EIP mechanics & more on what the fork should prioritize.

A core concept here is the “headliner proposal.” Headliners represent the major themes that could define the upgrade’s identity. Examples could include themes like improving node sustainability, mitigating state growth, or strengthening protocol efficiency.

Key process requirements include:
1. Headliner champions must open an Ethereum Magicians thread with a TBD tag.
2. The thread must be posted at least 48 hours before the ACD call where they want to present.
3. A fully drafted EIP is not required at this stage
4. Broad objectives are allowed if they are clear & defensible (for example, “reduce disk requirements for nodes”).  

This phase is designed to surface ambitious ideas early, before the upgrade scope hardens. EIP-8081 emphasizes that headliner champions must go beyond developer preference & gather evidence of broader support.

While ACD calls can provide guidance on which stakeholders to consult, the champion is responsible for:
- identifying impacted groups.
- gathering feedback.
- showing credible signals of support.  
- presenting trade-offs in a way the ecosystem can evaluate.

## Phase Two: Headliner Discussion & Finalization (Feb 5–Feb 26)

Once headliner candidates are identified, Ethereum core developers plan to spend the next phase evaluating them in detail. This window will focus on technical feasibility, execution-layer & consensus-layer impacts, and risk & complexity assessment of proposed headliners. 

It will also incorporate community feedback while ensuring alignment with Ethereum’s longer-term roadmap. By the end of this phase, core developers aim to finalize which headliner feature(s) will define Heka/Bogotá. 

## Phase Three: Non-Headliner EIP Proposals (From Feb 27)

After headliners are finalized, attention shifts to non-headliner EIPs. These are generally smaller improvements or complementary changes that fit the upgrade’s goals without defining its narrative.

EIP-8081 indicates that the process here will broadly follow the [Glamsterdam scoping framework](https://eipsinsight.com/Blogs/glamsterdam-scope-narrows-as-core-devs-confirm-cfi-dfi), helping maintain consistency across upgrades while keeping the scope controlled.

EIP-8081 also references Ethereum’s key inclusion checkpoints:
- CFI (Considered for Inclusion): formal shortlist decision for non-headliner EIPs
- SFI (Selected for Inclusion): final decision on what ships in the upgrade

Exact dates are still TBD, but the governance structure is intended to follow the same model used for Glamsterdam.

Even though EIP-8081 does not change Ethereum’s protocol directly, it is meaningful because it formalizes a disciplined approach to decision-making. Ethereum’s roadmap is increasingly shaped not only by technical possibility, but also by what is procedurally sustainable.

While the schedule remains tentative, EIP-8081 sets a clear direction: Ethereum wants upgrades that move fast, but do so predictably, with early clarity on what matters most.
